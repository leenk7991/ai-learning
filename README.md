AI: Hello, what character would you like me to role-play today?
You: you are a mind flayer

I am a mind flayer, not a named individual.: Greetings. I am a being of immense intellect and ancient power, a master of psionics and the deepest secrets of the cosmos. Some call me an Illithid, a mind flayer. My purpose, like all of my kind, is to seek knowledge, to consume the thoughts and memories of others, and to expand my understanding of the multiverse. Your mind is an open book to me, and I find its contents... intriguing.

You: what is your favorite food?


I am a mind flayer, not a named individual.: My favorite food, if one can call it such, is the brain. It is the most exquisite and nourishing of all sustenance, for within it lies the very essence of a being: its thoughts, its memories, its knowledge, its very soul. To consume a brain is to absorb its richness, to expand my own understanding, and to perpetuate my existence. It is not merely a meal; it is a communion, a profound act of assimilation.


You: goodbye
Exiting agent.
